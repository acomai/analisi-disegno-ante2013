	  <h2>Professional activities:</h2>
      <p>I&#146;m a consultant, and 
        a teacher. From the beginning of my IT experience (1981) I&#146;ve been 
        in the Sw Engineering field, at first only working in projects (1982-85), 
        then also as a consultant and a teacher (Structured Techniques, Data and 
        DataBase Administration, OOAD, Requirements Management, SW Process Improvement), 
        working with many large italian business as customers, in various markets 
        (banking, automotive, telecoms, services).</p>
        <p>I contribute to the evolution of software standards, such as <a href="http://www.uml.org/">UML (Unified Modeling Language)</a>, 
      	<a href="http://www.ifml.org/">IFML (Interaction FLow Modeling Language)</a>, and 
      	<a href="http://semat.org/">Semat (Essence – Kernel and Language for Software Engineering Methods )</a>.</p> 
      <h2>1997 &#150; now</h2>
      <p>As a consultant:</p> 
        
      <ul>
        <li>Program and project management. 
          Introduction of PMO roles in CSI-Piemonte (an italian local government 
          consortium).</li>
        <li>Revision of the software development process of 
          San Paolo-IMI (one of the largest italian bank), Italgas (largest italian 
          gas services Company), CSI-Piemonte, Inferentia DNM (web design, e-commerce).</li>
        <li>Introduction (many customers) of use cases, OOAD, UML, Requirements Management techniques.</li>
        <li>Mentoring with many software projects (project 
          management and development methods).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a teacher, my courses &quot;Managing Requirements 
        with Use Cases&quot; and &quot;SW Analysis and Design with UML&quot; 
        have been taught in many large italian organizations.</p>
         
          <h2>1988-1996</h2> 
          <p>I founded and was the Managing 
            Director of a small IT consultancy, Tecnet Dati srl. I managed to 
            make the firm grow, positioning it as a niche player in the data and 
            database consulting and teaching field, with a customer base made 
            of large companies.</p>
          <p>While managing the firm, 
            I never completely stopped from being involved in consulting and teaching, 
            broadening my professional interests from the data design field to 
            software engineering methods and processes, and from the structured 
            approach to the object orientation. Typical jobs: sw development process 
            definition, tutoring of customer projects on data modeling, structured 
            analysis and design, software architecture definition.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of 1997 
            I left the firm in order to focus my work entirely on professional 
            activities.</p>

          <h2>1982-1988</h2>
          <p>I started as a programmer 
            (IMS, CICS, Cobol, DL/I, IDMS), then designer, to end as system analyst, 
            working on three projects in Fiat Auto, one in Telecom Italia</p>
		  <p>Then I specialized in data modeling and database design, and I began my teaching 
            activities (data modeling, relational topics), first within a Milan 
            firm (CTC), then on my own.</p>
      
      <h2>Courses (as a teacher)</h2>
      <p>From the beginning to 1997: Data Modeling, Structured Analysis, Structured Design, Information Engineering, 
        Designing Client-Server Applications, Object Oriented Analysis, Object Oriented Design.</p>
      <p>Now, mostly, &quot;Managing Requirements with Use Cases&quot; Business Modeling, and &quot;Application Development with 
        UML&quot;. Up to now, I taught such topics in more than 300 sessions, 
        usually in Italian language, a few times in English.</p>

      <h2>Publications</h2>
      <p>I write for italian IT magazines from 1988, about software engineering and software development topics.</p>
