      <p>I work as an independent IT 
        consultant and teacher, with many years of experience in software engineering 
        (I started in 1981). </p>
	  <p>My professional activities have been mostly in requirements 
        management and in software systems analysis and design. I've also been 
        involved in many projects of process improvement for software development.</p>
      <p>My professional interests are 
        at the intersection of software development methods, organizational patterns 
        and communication aspects (I graduated in Philosophy and Italian Literature, 
        before starting my work in IT).</p>
      <p>I contribute to the evolution of software standards, such as <a href="http://www.uml.org/">UML (Unified Modeling Language)</a>, 
      	<a href="http://www.ifml.org/">IFML (Interaction FLow Modeling Language)</a>, and 
      	<a href="http://semat.org/">Semat (Essence â€“ Kernel and Language for Software Engineering Methods )</a>.</p>
      <p>I've published many articles in italian software 
        magazines. Here is my <a href="curriculum_eng.htm">curriculum vitae</a>.</p>
      <p>I am a member of <a href="http://www.acm.org" target="_blank">ACM</a> (Association for Computing Machinery), <a href="http://www.computer.org" target="_blank">IEEE 
        Computer Society</a> and <a href="http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org" target="_blank">AST</a> 
        (Association for Software Testing).</p>
