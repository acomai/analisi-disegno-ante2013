<p>[<b>Question</b>]: <i>Mr. Jacobson, you are widely known as the inventor of the
&quot;Use Case&quot; concept. How was this concept born? Which were the forces that
brought you to work on this idea? </i></p>


<p>[<b>Ivar Jacobson</b>]: It evolved over many years. First of all, I worked in
telecommunications in my early days, where exists the concept of &quot;traffic
cases&quot;. The traffic case was like a use case, it was, in fact, a telephone call.
There were many different kinds of telephone calls, many different kinds of traffic cases.
That was something I learned there. In that time we had no cases for other things than
telephone calls. In that early time, I mean back in 1967, I had another term that was
similar to use case, and meant the same thing: we called them &quot;functions&quot;. A
function crossed the whole system. A telephone call was a function, but functions were
also more abstract things, and the term was not really well defined. We used this
approach, &quot;function-driven development&quot;, that is called now
&quot;use-case-driven development&quot;. We identified the functions, and then we designed
the functions, like we do with use cases today. So these ideas are very old. </p>

<p>I identified the use case concept in 1986, and when I had found that concept I knew I
found something that solved many problems to me, because I could use this concept for
everything that systems did, and for every kind of system. It helped me a lot to create a
systematic methodology.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>The Use case concept is like a filter that distinguishes between
functions related to the user and functions internal to the system&#133;</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: Yes, it discriminates lots of functions, that can not be use cases. It's
much more specific. A function could be anything, that's the problem. Use cases cannot be
anything.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>What are the roots, the ancestors to the UC concept in the software
engineering literature?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: I don't know. Actually, I don't have anything like that. I think the
closest thing was this idea of traffic cases.</p>

<p>But I want to make a point. It may be the truth that I am most known for the use cases,
but we had component-based development in 1967, and use cases were not there, so
component-based development is something I've been working in my whole life. The other
think is architecture, I mean really to identify an architecture before doing everything
else. We talked about software architecture in 1968. We presented the software
architecture when we went out to our customers, and I remember they had never heard about
anything like that. They tought about architecture for hardware, but there was not an
architecture for software.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>The use case concept seems, today, almost obvious, common sense...</i> </p>

<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: And I think it is.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Yet it was marvelous to see how quickly and broadly it was accepted by
other methodologists. How could this happen with so few resistances?</i> </p>

<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: Most of the methodologists went into the objects world, and there was a
lot of competition. However, the use case didn't compete with anything, and it solved a
problem that everyone had. Even the concept of scenario was about something internal to
the system, about internal interactions, but was not really specified.</p>

<p>One thing I did late was to publish. If you look upon my 1987 paper, for the OOPSLA,
there I had all these things, but the problem I had was that I could sell my book, the
Objectory book, in 1990-1991, for 25.000 $ a copy, so why should I go and give it away to
Addison-Wesley or any other publisher, to then get 3 $ a copy, even if that was selling
many more? Now I understand that I should have done it a little bit differently, but it's
very hard to say, you have to be at the right time. So I think the other books helped us,
because they had a big problem, that was how to get from requirements to start an OO
analysis and design, but I refuse the idea that just the fact that people publish their
book, they were first with the idea: they were older ideas.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Use case specifications are mainly textual (although they can be
complemented with UML diagrams). Previous methods (as Structured Analysis, or Information
Engineering) proposed the use of diagrams as a &quot;common language&quot; to reach an
agreement between customers (&quot;users&quot;) and developers. What's behind this
resurgence of the role of text?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: In reality, today, customers of software don't want to read diagrams. Use
case diagrams are so intuitive that everyone can read them. Text is something people don't
need to learn a special language to use. </p>

<p>We can use activity diagrams to describe use cases, and it's very nice, but there are
two problems with that. First, they become very quickly very detailed, and it's not sure
that they are more understandable because they are detailed, even if there is no doubt
that at some point you need to specify in more detail. But we think that the best way to
do that is in terms of the analysis model, where you describe every use case as a
collaboration among objects, instead of trying to detail the use case without talking
about objects. You can use activity diagrams, but activities can be very abstract, so it's
very hard to understand them, you really need to understand what has to be done, to
understand the activities. So I'm very careful in introducing a formalism in use cases. I
think that when you go to analysis you get a much better formalism, a much better language
to express details, because you talk about objects. </p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Maybe activity diagrams cannot convey so much information as text &#133;
</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: Yes, it's just a pragmatic thing, it's not a holy cow. In some cases it is
maybe good to use activity diagrams, but I think I want to have a warning there, because
it's better to be detailed when you have the right language to express details. And I
think that in analysis when we talk about objects, and about collaborations between
objects, even if these objects are conceptual, and not physical, implementation things,
they are much more concrete and much easier to understand than just activities.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>What about the ambiguity of natural language?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: Yes, it is ambiguous, but I think there is a trade-off. &#133; Language is
understandable, it's ok to use just english. On the other hand, in situations when we have
hard use cases, with a lot of interactions, you may need to go further. But it's better to
view the analysis model as part of the requirements. In the new Unified Process book I've
taken a little step in that direction, I view analysis as a part of requirements, and one
of the things we get from analysis is the structure that we would like to see in the
design and in the implementation, so we have some requirements on the architecture that we
create through analysis.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Use cases have a double role in your method. First, they are used to
discover and to validate requirements coming from customers and users. Then, they drive
the whole system development. Is one of these roles more important than the other?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: No, of course not. But many methodologists, and many software developers
are very technology-introvert. If the use case concept wasn't so good in describing
interactions, and helping to define collaborations, they wouldn't have bought into it. So
it does work as a very good sales argument to software developers: they would never have
been accepted as widely as they are, if they hadn't this impact on the design, if they
didn't drive the development. For me, anyway, both aspects are equally important, it's a
very nice way to find the requirements, and to capture requirements in some kind of
diagram, without going into the internals of the system. They are used to capture and to
identify scenarios, and describe relationships between these things.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>In your book, you speak about feature list of requirements as a starting
point to derive use cases.</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: The feature list is something that will be translated to use cases, and
the documentation will describe the use cases, so the feature list will grow and shrink,
as you translate the requested features into use cases.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Some years ago, you applied the use case concept, and other Objectory
ideas, to the business process reengineering area. How well has been your proposal
accepted by non-IT people? Are use cases used in business engineering so much as in the IT
area?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: No, they are not, for several reasons. Rational has selected to work
primarily in software, even if we understand completely the importance to do business
engineering. However, we also know that the tools people need for business engineering are
easily described in terms of tools for software engineering. If you have Rose for visual
modeling, you can extend it, to make it work for business engineering as well, but not the
other way round. We still need to have a good tool for visual modeling of software. We
have been working on Business Engineering, but we have done it locally, in Scandinavia,
and we have in Sweden a Service Package from Rational, called Rational Business
Engineering, with a specialization of Rose and detailed process descriptions.</p>

<p>Anyway, the customer base for software engineering is much larger. People who wants to
do business modeling are typically people who understand software, and who understand they
need more. It's very sad that people from business engineering, like Hammer, didn't think
about modeling so much, so the stream of people that come from that part is much fewer,
most people come to business modeling from the software world. It's a much smaller
business, but we have customers with hundreds of licences of Rose for Business
Engineering, for example in one telecom company and in the swedish pension system. </p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Did you have any contact with people like Hammer or Champy about your
business modeling proposal?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: No, I read their books, of course, and, we have been doing business
engineering for many years, but when I read the books I said: &quot;oh, here we have a guy
who presents a problem, and he gives a sketch, an outline of the solution, but he cannot
model it, and if you don't model it you don't understand it&quot;. Anyway, I feel that
Hammer work and our work were very tighly related. </p>

<p>Another important idea is one-to-one marketing. One of the people that worked for me at
Objectory is now working on it, and she thinks that our approach is perfect for it. This
is an area in which I'm thinking to do more work in the future. I always work in the long
term, on what happens five years from now and so on, and there are two areas in which I
will work in the near future, one is business engineering, and how that is impacted by the
new world, the internet world, and the other thing is software development in the context
of the web, applications for the web. Even if the web changes everything, and it changes
basically everything we do in business, the way we develop software for the web doesn't
change very much. It's basically the same thing, but there is one thing that is different,
and that's the user interface. The user interface design is very important.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>I saw you quote from Larry Constantine in your last book about this
issue. Do you like his approach?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: Very much. His last book is a very good one. The only problem I have with
it is that, instead of using the UML, he uses his own notation which is much weaker, not
so well defined, and he has a different approach to what a model is, but there are lots of
good things in that book. I like it a lot, it's the best book I've seen in 3 years in
software.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Is it more difficult to persuade IT- or non IT-people of the importance
to do business modeling as a starting point for a new project or for the evolution of an
existing system? </i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: The problem is that we don't have the time. Time-to-market is today&#133;
it's more important that you get something out than that it's a good thing, and that means
that these approaches must be very tightly integrated. IT people know that to do business
models takes 6 months, 12 months, and when they start to build the software, the business
has changed. What's unique about our approach is that business modeling is part of the
process, so if you have a software that takes 6 months to develop, than you do business
engineering for 6 months. I can understand that people hesitate to do business modeling:
if we think quality is not so important in order to get it out, then we will always have
problems with any structured approach to develop software. But with iterative development
we get something out according to the plan, and I think that will help people to
understand the need for business modeling, continuously, during all the time.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>The UML was a collective creation. And so the Unified Process. But in
the latter, your own contribution is more clear, more apparent. UP roots are more in the
Objectory / OOSE ground than in the Booch method or in OMT. Does this reflect a sort of
&quot;division of labor&quot; among the Amigos? </i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: I don't think that we have divided on purpose. Some people are experts on
everything, and it's hard to see that anyone of us three would agree that there is an area
in which we don't have any expertise. Honestly, I think there is no division of work. It's
a fact that we started from Objectory, when developing the Rational Unified Process, and
from there we have evolved. And of course, you cannot move from object modeling, just
object modeling. There is not a simple way to go from approaches like OMT, or Booch, to do
what we did in Objectory. So it is easier to go the other way round, thinking about use
cases and then you have objects and classes and subsystems to design. </p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Booch and Rumbaugh moved from software, while you moved from customers
and users &#133;</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: Yes, but there is also another aspect. Components are what we have to
start with. I actually started with components. In 1967, when I was introducing this
approach at Ericsson, the main objection I had from developers was that these components,
that we developed, were not easily related to the &quot;functions&quot;, or the &quot;use
cases&quot;. If you take the use case, the use case crosses many components: that was an
objection. They were thinking in terms of &quot;one function, one module&quot;.</p>

<p>Whereas I was saying, well, that's not ok. Most of one function, or one use case, will
be implemented by one component; but then the other components will play a role in that
use case. So that was one of the objections. And I said: that's exactly this objection
that I will turn into something positive: this is exactly what you need, you need to have
that complexity, because that's how it is. So the outside world talks about use cases, but
inside use cases cross these components - subsystems. </p>

<p>Just having objects and components, and don't care about things that cross them, is a
smaller problem. One of the difficult things is to make use case realizations, and to
manage dependencies between subsystems, and that's much harder. Thinking just upon objects
is a much smaller problem, it's a sub-problem.</p>

<p>No, I don't think there is any conscious decision on dividing work - we think that the
UML was a big task, and we had to work together to get it done. Now we are working on
different things; we just don't think it's meaningful to work together on everything.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Do you expect for the Unified Process a success and an impact on the IT
industry, analogous to that of the UML?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: Yes, absolutely yes, and we have very good reasons to believe that. We are
making inroads into many corporations today, and it's our goal to get there. We don't
think it would be an easy thing to make the Unified Process a standard, it would be so
much hard work and so much opposition, so we'd rather do it in small steps. Instead of
going and forcing people through a standard, let people convince themselves. And I think
that everyone that looks at the Rational Unified Process will become convinced this is the
way they've got to do it, as soon as they have started to look at it. There is nothing
even close to it. Many people tried to say that there is, but what is that they have? They
have something that can be compared with my book, but they don't have anything that can be
compared with our process. If you just look upon it in terms of substance, and depth, and
experience, and so on, and if you compare &#133; How old is Approach A, or Approach B? Do
we know that it works, for large projects? We know that our works. It's really very
different. </p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>How much of Objectory is left in the Unified Process?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: If you look just upon the basic ideas, we basically only covered
requirements, analysis and design in Objectory. If you look upon these things, what was in
Objectory in the old days is still there. But there's a lot of new stuff that has been
added. We had very little about implementation, very little about testing, nothing about
configuration management and version control, nothing about project management. Iterative
development was primarily something we recommended, but it was not enforced by the
process, we didn't really tell about the differences among the various iterations, so I
think the core ideas are still there, but there are lots of other things that have been
added. The Rational Unified Process is really a teamwork, we have a lot of people that
have been involved. Whereas the Objectory Process was primarily my ideas, my work that we
implemented. But, given the smaller resources we had, it was quit a lot.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>You present every iteration like a mini-waterfall &#133;</i></p>


</font><p><font FACE="Arial">[<b>IJ</b>]: Yes, we think of it as a mini-waterfall, but we have a lot of parallelism.
Within the waterfall, the people who develop subsystems work concurrently on their
subsystems. So people who work on use cases rather independently talk to one another so
they don't invent new things and so they</font><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff"> </font><font FACE="Arial">reuse the same components, but they work concurrently on subsystems during an
iteration. But that is still waterfall, because you always start with requirements, then
you go through analysis, and then through design activities.</font></p><font FACE="Arial">

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>You come from Sweden. Do you feel there is an European specificity in
system and software engineering? Maybe more concern, more care about organizational issues
than in the US?</i></p>


<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: I have not been able to find any systematic difference, because I found
people in the US very interested in starting with the business, in understanding the
business, before they develop the software, and in Europe too. There is no systematic
difference. It would be more funny&#133; There has been a lot of research, in Europe, in
areas that are more at an abstract level, and less in the concrete, physical world, but I
must say that a lot of research has been done, and with useful results, both in the US and
in Europe - and also a lot of work done that never led to anything.</p>

<p>[<b>Q</b>]: <i>Now the greatest part of the &quot;unifying&quot; effort is done. Are
you going to rest, and capitalize on it, or are you moving forward to other areas of
interest? What next?</i> </p>

<p>[<b>IJ</b>]: There is one part of me that says: I want to go ahead, and look for what
needs to be done, to create a much better world, and we have a lot of things to do. In a
way, UML is a standard, and that's wonderful. But it doesn't mean that these are new
ideas, we just got them consolidated. In the last years, I don't think I've done anything
really new, I pushed the adoption process more than the creation process. Now a part of me
wants to take a next step. What is beyond the Unified Process? What is beyond UML? I think
it is still an evolution, not a revolution, but there are some important steps that need
to happen in software, to get up to the level of extremely high quality which we need to
develop the systems we will want to develop in the 2020, or something like that. These are
much larger systems than we can think of today, and more complex, and we need to be able
to develop these systems. We need a much better infrastructure than we have today, in
terms of operating systems, programming languages, UML integrated with programming
languages, maybe part of the UML will be a programming language, with action language
semantics and so on. That's one thing I'm constantly thinking of . </p>

</font><p><font FACE="Arial">The other thing is to capitalize on business engineering. There is something really
interesting to get done, there. The Rational Unified Process is very well prepared for the
Web. Many of the companies who develop websites are using the Rational Unified Process
today, specializing it a little bit, so it fits for their special purposes, but it's the
same process. I would like to see that we extend and make the right decisions to make the
required model improvements, in the Rational Unified Process, changes</font><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff"> </font><font FACE="Arial">that make it clearly, without any
doubt, &quot;the&quot; process for web sites applications design.</font></p><font FACE="Arial">

<p>I'm also going to write a revision of my book &quot;The Object Advantage&quot; for the
end of this year. The Internet, and ideas like one-to-one marketing, will have a lot of
impact on this revision. We need to make the book more approachable for business people,
and not only for software people. We will show how to use it in the context of business,
not only in the context of software. The basic ideas are already there, it works very
well, customers are happy, but today we need to take that through the barrier of IT,
solving the problem existing with the acceptance of technical notation. Activity diagrams
are very useful for business modeling.</p>
